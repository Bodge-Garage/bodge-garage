Welcome to the Bodge Garage!
The whole point of this is for me to dump my automation scripts and programs, partially for backup and partially to hopefully inspire someone out there like Tom Scott inspired me one day with his emoji keyboard. One of my favorite things to write are bodged together automation tasks to make my lazy ass not have to do as much. Code found here won't be the most efficient, or prettiest or most practical code. That would ruin the point. This code is designed to get the job done and only the job done, nothing more, nothing less. If you say anything about my coding practices, kindly fuck off :)


Oh also, it's all very specific to my machine, so I don't know how much help it'll bring people.
